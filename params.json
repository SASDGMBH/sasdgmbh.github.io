We are locate in Darmstadt - Germany.\r\n \r\n### Creating Software as a business \r\nIf you develop software manually you often have to create things again and again, like Database connection class or logging facility. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, we like to generate code focused on the usability of the project User Interface not on the part nobody can see. In every days work reusing staff makes it easy to create good Software without having the paint to create every thing from scratch. We plan to offer intelligent open source classes support the back-end features for public us but as especially for our use. \r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou will find our open Source Projects at @SASDGMBH on GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with this Page?
